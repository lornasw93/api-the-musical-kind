# Presenting... API, the Musical Kind üéµ

## Project Setup

### Backend
* Tech stack: NET Core 3.1, Swagger, REST API Hosting: Azure (App Service, CI/CD)
* URL: [https://api-the-musical-kind.backend.lorna.dev](https://api-the-musical-kind.backend.lorna.dev/)
* Repo: [https://github.com/lornasw93/api-the-musical-kind.backend](https://github.com/lornasw93/api-the-musical-kind.backend)

### Frontend
* Tech stack: Angular 9, Bootstrap Hosting: Firebase
* URL: [https://api-the-musical-kind.lorna.dev](https://api-the-musical-kind.lorna.dev/)
* Repo: [https://github.com/lornasw93/api-the-musical-kind.frontend](https://github.com/lornasw93/api-the-musical-kind.frontend)

### APIs Used
* Shazam
* Lyrics OVH

## Quick Start 
If you are wanting to run locally, please ensure both BE and FE projects are running simultaneously. Or check out the live FE URL above.

### Frontend
Run `npm install` in the *ClientApp* directory and once finished `ng serve --o` it.

### Backend
#### Prerequisites 

You'll need to setup an account to use the Shazam API [here](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/shazam) and get an API key. My *appsettings.json* file looks like this (with the API key and irreverent bits omitted):
```
{
  "ShazamApi": {
    "Key": "############################################"
  } 
}
```
I'm using this particular API to do a general search. The method in my service class to use it looks like this (again, irrelevant bits omitted):
```
public Search Get(string resourceUrl)
{
    const string baseUrl = "https://shazam.p.rapidapi.com/";
    const string host = "shazam.p.rapidapi.com";
    var key = _config["ShazamApi:Key"];

    var baseAddress = new Uri(baseUrl);

    using var httpClient = new HttpClient { BaseAddress = baseAddress };

    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-RapidAPI-Host", host);
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-RapidAPI-Key", key);

    using var response = httpClient.GetAsync("search?locale=en-GB&offset=0&limit=5&term=" + resourceUrl);

    var responseData = response.Result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    var result = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Search>(responseData.Result);
 
    return result;
}
```
Once you've setup your account and copied over the API key, restore Nuget packages, build and run the project.  
 
## Overview 
I **really** enjoyed working on tech test and spent any time I could on it. It's an expandable project and for my self-development I will absolutely continue to work on it and implement the above list. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### If I had more time I would have... ‚è≥
* Generating charts (if only!!)
* Added authentication - Identity Server maybe
* Added testing (unit, Jasmine)
* UI / UX more focus
* Better error handling
* Where no results to display a message
* Improved page speeds/SEO
	* Lazy loading images
	* Compress images
	* Added meta tags
	* Async methods
* To investigate when sometimes the lyrics count 0 when it shouldn't be üêû

### However, I have... ‚úÖ
* Developed 2 separate projects (BE, FE) using different tech stacks including hosting
* Created new sub-domains to use
* FE is from scratch, no template
* BE is minimal
* Tested APIs using Postman and Swagger
* Clear and 'pretty' design
* Responsive
* SPA
* Combining 2 existing APIs (Shazam, Lyrics OVH)
* Inserted some Lorna personality (I've seen Matrix 1)
