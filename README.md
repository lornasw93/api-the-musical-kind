## Project Setup

### Backend

* URL: [https://api-the-musical-kind.backend.lorna.dev](https://api-the-musical-kind.backend.lorna.dev/)
* Repo: [https://github.com/lornasw93/api-the-musical-kind.backend](https://github.com/lornasw93/api-the-musical-kind.backend)

### Frontend
* Tech stack: Angular 9, Bootstrap Hosting: Firebase
* URL: [https://api-the-musical-kind.lorna.dev](https://api-the-musical-kind.lorna.dev/)

## Quick Start 
If you are wanting to run locally, please ensure both BE and FE projects are running simultaneously. Or check out the live FE URL above.

### Frontend
Run `npm install` in the `ClientApp` directory and once finished `ng serve --o` it.

### Backend
Restore Nuget packages, build and run it.
 
## Overview 
I **really** enjoyed working on tech test and spent any time I could on it. It's an expandable project and for my self-development I will absolutely continue to work on it and implement the above list. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### If I had more time I would have... ‚è≥
* Generating charts (if only!!)
* Added authentication - Identity Server maybe
* Added testing (unit, Jasmine)
* UI / UX more focus
* Better error handling
* Where no results to display a message
* Improved page speeds/SEO
	* Lazy loading images
	* Compress images
	* Added meta tags


### However, I have... ‚úÖ
* Developed 2 separate projects (BE, FE) using different tech stacks including hosting
* Created new sub-domains to use
* FE is from scratch, no template
* BE is minimal
* Tested APIs using Postman and Swagger
* Clear and 'pretty' design
* Responsive
* SPA
* Combining 2 existing APIs (Shazam, Lyrics OVH)
* Inserted some Lorna personality (I've seen Matrix 1)
